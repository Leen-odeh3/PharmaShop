## Highlights  
✅ **Tech Stack & Key Features:**

- **ASP.NET Core 8.0:**  
  The latest version of ASP.NET Core, providing a fast, secure, and reliable framework for building modern APIs and web applications.

- **Onion Architecture:**  
  A layered architecture designed to separate core business logic from dependencies like the database and UI, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

- **SQL Server:**  
  A robust and reliable database system used for storing product data, user information, and transactions.

- **ASP.NET Core Identity:**  
  An integrated authentication and authorization system with role-based management (admin, customer, pharmacist).

- **JWT Authentication:**  
  Secure token-based authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing secure role management and session handling.

- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core):**  
  Object-relational mapping (ORM) for working with SQL Server and implementing efficient database operations.

- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query):**  
  A query syntax used for data querying and manipulation, enabling powerful interactions with EF Core for complex queries.

- **Generic Repository & Unit of Work Pattern:**  
  Implements a clean, maintainable data access layer.

- **Mapster:**  
  Efficient mapping between domain models and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for optimized data transfer between application layers.

- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):**  
  Simplifies data handling and communication between layers of the application.

- **Specification Pattern:**  
  Used for dynamic querying and filtering within the repository layer.

- **Data Seeding:**  
  Automatic population of the database with default users, roles, and products.

- **Session Management:**  
  Session handling is used to track user-specific data during interactions with the platform, such as login status, cart items, and preferences. This ensures a seamless experience by maintaining user session data across requests.
